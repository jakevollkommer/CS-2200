/*
 * This problem has you solve the classic "bounded buffer" problem with
 * one producer and multiple consumers:
 *
 *                                       ------------
 *                                    /->| consumer |
 *                                    |  ------------
 *                                    |
 *  ------------                      |  ------------
 *  | producer |-->   bounded buffer --->| consumer |
 *  ------------                      |  ------------
 *                                    |
 *                                    |  ------------
 *                                    \->| consumer |
 *                                       ------------
 *
 *  The program below includes everything but the implementation of the
 *  bounded buffer itself.  main() does this:
 *
 *  1. starts N consumers as per the first argument (default 1)
 *  2. starts the producer
 *
 *  The producer reads positive integers from standard input and passes those
 *  into the buffer.  The consumers read those integers and "perform a
 *  command" based on them (all they really do is sleep for some period...)
 *
 *  on EOF of stdin, the producer passes N copies of 0 into the buffer.
 *  The consumers interpret 0 as a signal to exit.

 * The interpretation is as follows:                                      *
 *                                                                        *
 * o  positive integer N: sleep for N * 100ms                             *
 * o  negative integer:  exit                                             *

 * Note that a thread procedure (called by pthread_create) is required to *
 * take a void * as an argument and return a void * as a result.  We play *
 * a dirty trick: we pass the thread number (main()'s idea of the thread  *
 * number) as the "void *" argument.  Hence the casts.  The return value  *
 * is ignored so we return NULL.                                          *
